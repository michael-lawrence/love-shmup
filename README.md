# love-shmup

A simple shoot em' up game written in Lua with the LÖVE 2D framework.
<br/>I'm using this as a way to learn Lua, LÖVE, and GLSL.
<br/>Currently this is in super early stages of development and really just meant as a learning experiment. 

### To run the game, you'll need to:
1. Install [LÖVE 2D](https://love2d.org/).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `/path/to/love /path/to/love-shmup/src`.

### Controls
* WASD/Arrow keys: Move up, down, left, right
* Space bar: Shoot
